Geo Tag in space

This repository contains the source code for the geo-tagging API and front-end to visualize a tag.

The API consists in the following main components:

 * Node modules to manage the rest api and to connect with externals modules.
 * A server exposing an API to interact with third-party services and returns sorted search results.

## Requirements

- Node 0.10.x & NPM

Use whatever you want to install them (from source, homebrew, apt).

## Run

Run the API server:

```
npm install
npm start
```

The server should be running on http://localhost:3000.


## Contributing

Everything works around one branch (`master`) to follow the [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).
